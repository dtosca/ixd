<h2>Good interface: the Beauty Blender</h2>

<h3>What it's for</h3>
<p>A sponge for putting on makeup.</p>

<p>I sent a picture of a Beauty Blender to my friend to test his makeup skills. I asked him "What is this?" and he said "A pink teardrop."</p>

<h3>Good things:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Affordances: being able to hold it and squish it.</li>
  <li>Because it's made of a spongey material, you can assume it's abosrbant.</li>
  <li>Pointed tip as a signifier for getting makeup into crevices.</li>
  <li>Wider base for applying makeup to larger areas.</li>
  <li>It's light pink color allows the user to know when it's dirty and needs to be cleaned.</li>
</ul>

<h3>However...</h3>

<ul>
  <li>It's not obvious that you're meant to wet it before using it so that it doesn't absorb as much makeup product.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Bad interface: a stove designed by Satan</h2>

<img src="https://dtosca.github.io/ixd/assets/img/stove.jpeg" alt="A grey stove with 6 dials, one for the light, one for the oven temperature, and four for the stovetop, all lined in a row. It has four burners on top and an oven. It reads 'Avanti' in cursive letters." height="600" width="397"/>

<h3>What it's for</h3>
<p>Heating things up to cook them and causing house fires.</p>

<p>I once left the stovetop burner running all night because I couldn't tell it was turned on.</p>

<h3>Bad things:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Learnability and discoverability is terrible! Figuring out how to turn on the oven was a nightmare.</li>
  <li>Feedback for when the oven is turned on is obscured from the user.</li>
  <li>No signifiers for when the oven has reached the desired temperature.</li>
  <li>If the oven fire turns off in the middle of baking, there is nothing to show that it is cooling down (which has ruined my brownie batches before)!</li>
  <li>Mapping of the dials to the stovetop is ass.</li>
  <li>Nothing to signify if the stovetop is still hot.</li>
</ul>

<h3>I'll give it one thing:</h3>
  <ul>
  	<li>The stovetop dials don't just turn, you have to push them in to turn them, which prevents accidentally turning the burners on.</li>
  </ul>
