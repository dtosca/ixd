<p>As a young artist who has made the mistake of never documentaing anything, I was glad that all my professors decided to mandate having process blogs for class.</p>

<p>Except, of course, I had to go and overcomplicate things.</p>

<a href="https://twitter.com/toscadiana/status/1438520107848933378"><img src="https://dtosca.github.io/audiohardware/assets/img/tweet.png" alt="screenshot of a tweet that reads: 'my professors: make a blog. it's simple, shouldn't take too long. Me: I will spend three days learning two new blog frameworks that don't work.'"></a>
<br>
<p>I didn't want to make a Wordpress blog, because I don't know anything about Wordpress.</p>

<p>I didn't want to use Medium, because I think it's too messy to manage three different blogs on a single site.</p>

<p>So I opted to go for a Jekyll blog hosted on GitHub pages. After all, <a href="https://undenailable.github.io/">I've done it before</a>, so it should be simple.</p>

<p>Except, in the world of programming, nothing is ever straightforward!</p>

<p>Naturally, I spent three days debugging, and ended up learning two different blog frameworks. Why? Probably the sunk cost fallacy.</p>

<p>I hope this doesn't foreshadow how the entire class will go. :)</p>

<p>Conclusion: yay, it works!</p>
